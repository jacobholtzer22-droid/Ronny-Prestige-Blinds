/**
 * Background footage for a mid-page band. Not the hero: see HeroVideo for
 * that one, which is above the fold and must load eagerly.
 *
 * THREE PLAYBACK RULES, all load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. NOTHING BELOW THE FOLD PRELOADS. No src is set until the band is close
 *    to the viewport. A `preload="none"` attribute would not be enough: with
 *    src present the browser may still fetch, and on a static export every
 *    byte here is a byte the hero is competing with.
 * 2. PLAY ON ENTER, PAUSE ON LEAVE, via IntersectionObserver. A band playing
 *    three screens away is decode work and battery for something nobody can
 *    see.
 * 3. ONLY ONE VIDEO PLAYS AT A TIME, enforced across components by the
 *    module-level registry below. Two background clips decoding at once is
 *    where a mid-range phone starts dropping frames in the scroll itself.
 *
 * The registry in lib/video-playback.ts is shared with the hero, so the
 * one-at-a-time rule holds across components rather than only within this
 * one.
 *
 * Failure is always safe, exactly as in the hero: the poster is a real <img>
 * that is always rendered and never removed, so a declined autoplay, reduced
 * motion, data saver, or a decode failure all land on a complete still with
 * no layout shift.
 *
 * STACKING. This component paints at z-0 and expects its section to position
 * the copy above it, which is how components/Hero.tsx is already built in
 * this template. Do not give it a negative z-index: against a STATIC copy
 * block a positioned element at z-0 paints on top whatever the DOM order, and
 * in the client repo this was ported from that rendered a hero with no text
 * at all until the media was pushed to -z-20 and the scrim to -z-10. Either
 * convention works; mixing them does not.
